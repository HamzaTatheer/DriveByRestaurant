# Running the backend

- create a file inside backend called .env if not already created and add these

    DB_URL='mongodb://root:example@localhost:27017'
    JWT_PRIVATE_KEY='SEproj_jwtPrivateKey'
    PORT=3000

    you can change DB_URL with the the mongo url you are using eg. "mongodb://localhost/Project"

- after that you will run "npm install" if you just pulled or cloned the remote repo. Otherwise not needed

- after that you will run npm start
